G=(V,E) where V: vertices; E: edges
graph: directed or undirected
  + direted: each edge has a direction A-------->B : A is parent of B
  + undirected: move in both directions b/t vertices
edges: weighted or unweighted
2 adjacent edges if they are connected to same vertex
1 edges joins 2 vertices: incident to both vertices
degree of a vertex is # of edges incident to it
loop: 1 edge links a vertex to itself
2 vertices connected by 2+ edges, these edges called parallel edges
simple graph: doesn't have any loop or parrallel edges
complete graph: every 2 pairs of vertices are connected
a graph is connected if there exists a path b/t any 2 vertices in the graph
a subgraph of a graph G whose vertex is a subset of that of Gand whose edge set is a subset of that of G
connected and undireted: 
  cycle is a closed path starts from a vertex and end at the same vertex
  connected graph is a tree if it doesn't have cyles
  spanning tree of a graph G is a connected subgraph of G and the subgraph is a tree that contains all vertices in G
